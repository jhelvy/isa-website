# "Industry, Innovation, and Policy in Uncertain Times"

**2026 ISA Annual Conference | June 3-5, 2026**

**George Washington University, Washington, D.C.**

## Conference Overview

The Industry Studies Association invites researchers to submit abstracts for papers and organized panels to their 2026 Annual Conference. The event takes place June 3-5, 2026 at George Washington University in Washington, D.C.

## Conference Theme

"Industry, Innovation, and Policy in Uncertain Times" describes the contemporary landscape where businesses navigate technological disruption, geopolitical shifts, supply chain vulnerabilities, climate demands, and labor market changes. The theme emphasizes how innovation increasingly occurs within active and consequential policy environments. However, submissions addressing this theme are optional—any rigorous scholarship focusing on organizations and industry dynamics is welcome.

## Venue

George Washington University sits in the nation's capital, positioned near the White House, Congress, federal agencies, and policy institutions. The location also provides access to Washington's innovation ecosystem, featuring clusters in cybersecurity, defense and aerospace, data and AI ventures, global development, and healthcare policy.

## Submission Guidelines

**Single Papers:** Submit abstracts of up to 250 words through Microsoft's Academic Conference Management Toolkit.

**Organized Panels:** Include a panel description plus individual paper abstracts (250 words each) or panelist listings with roles. Panels should feature unifying themes—such as shared methodologies across industries or diverse approaches to common challenges. Panels incorporating practitioners from industry, government, or organizations receive particular encouragement.
