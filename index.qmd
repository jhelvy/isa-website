## Important Update: Website Transition

We are currently transitioning our website host from **MemberClicks** to **Novi AMS**. The new Novi AMS site will be up and running by **mid-January**. This is a placeholder site while construction is underway.

### Conference Submission Site is LIVE

Our conference submission site is hosted separately on **Microsoft CMT**, which is still live and will not change. You can submit any time between now and the conference submission deadline - see the guidelines page for details:
