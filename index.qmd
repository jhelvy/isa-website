## Important Update: Website Transition

We are currently transitioning our website host from **MemberClicks** to **Novi**. The new Novi site will be up and running by **mid-January**.

:::

### Conference Submission Site is LIVE

Fortunately, our conference submission site is hosted separately on **Microsoft CMT**, which is still live and will not change. You can submit any time between now and the new deadline, and the submission site will not change even as our new website goes live.
