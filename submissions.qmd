# Conference Submissions

The Industry Studies Association invites researchers to submit abstracts for papers and organized panels to the 2026 Annual Conference, taking place June 3-5, 2026 at George Washington University in Washington, D.C.

## Submission Guidelines

**Single Papers:** Submit abstracts of up to 250 words through Microsoft's Academic Conference Management Toolkit.

**Organized Panels:** Include a panel description plus individual paper abstracts (250 words each) or panelist listings with roles. Panels should feature unifying themes—such as shared methodologies across industries or diverse approaches to common challenges. Panels incorporating practitioners from industry, government, or organizations receive particular encouragement.

## How to Submit via Microsoft CMT

All submissions are handled through Microsoft CMT (Conference Management Toolkit), which is a separate website from the ISA site. You can create a CMT account using any email address—it will only be used for managing your conference submission and is not linked to your ISA website account. If you don't already have a CMT account, you'll be prompted to create one when you first visit the submission portal.
