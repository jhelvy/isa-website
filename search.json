Such research often spans multiple disciplinary perspectives, offering insights that can support evidence-based policymaking and managerial decision-making.\nThe ISA aims to elevate the profile of industry studies research and its positive impact on realized public policy and industry outcomes. We accomplish this by identifying, connecting, and recognizing scholars undertaking industry studies research, facilitating interdisciplinary dialogue and exchanges rich in industry context, and fostering direct interactions between academia, industry, and policymakers.\n\n\nVision\nWe aspire to a future where:\n\nIndustry studies research is regularly published in top academic journals;\nThe ISA’s conferences are the leading venue where top academic researchers, key policymakers, business media, and other key thought leaders exchange ideas and insights;\nThe ISA engages a global audience, with periodic events outside of the United States;\nISA members regularly are called upon by the media and others to provide insight to phenomena in their industry;\nPublic policymakers, managers, and thought leaders around the globe actively seek out industry studies scholars to help improve public policy;\nIndustry studies activities, such as commenting on proposed public policies in a researcher’s domain, are rewarded.",

    "text": "What is Industry Studies?\nScholars who pursue industry studies come from a wide variety of disciplines such as management, economics, engineering, industrial and labor relations, operations research, law, economic geography, and public policy. While this list is by no means comprehensive, it does suggest the very broad range of disciplines that find value in collaborating around industry studies research. Industry studies scholars may focus their attention on particular industries or occupations, or conduct cross-industry analysis. Across research interests and disciplines, industry studies scholars make the kind of personal investment of time that is necessary to learn about the market and firm institutions in the industry or industries they study. This kind of engagement, which includes close interaction with industry practitioners and often includes direct observation at the plant, firm, or establishment level, allows industry studies scholars to pursue academic research from a broad and deep basis of understanding about the subject of their analysis. Its effect is evident in the selection of research questions, the methodologies employed, the nature of related analysis, and/or the interpretation of findings.\nScholars committed to industry studies research have demonstrated that the results of industry research that is grounded in observation and integrated with theory and analysis can make important contributions not only to academic knowledge, but also to industry practice and public policy.",
